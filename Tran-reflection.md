#Release 7: Reflect

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
The github workflow confused me for a little bit prior to this GPS session. I didn't quite understand why we didn't merge our feature branch locally to the master, and then push it up. After this GPS session, I understood why. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
The concept of pushing your feature branch to github and having a reviewer confirm the merge request was clarified in this session. Also merge conflicts was clarified as well.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
I asked my pair how did we get to the merge conflict when I was the driver during release 5. I asked her how do we solve a merge conflict. I didn't ask my guide any questions. 

**What still confuses you about Git?**
At the moment, I can't think of anything that confuses me about Git.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My first experience pairing in a GPS was fantastic. I love the tips that were given to us by our guide. She knew when to drop by when my pair and I were stuck on a problem. I also love that my pair asked a lot of questions. Some of the questions she asked was something I would have never thought of, so I learned a lot from her asking questions.
