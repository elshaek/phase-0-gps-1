#GPS 1.1 Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

None in particular that I was struggling with in the Week 1 material; but the GPS helped clarify the reasons behind certain steps, and I probably need more practice to be able to know everything off the back of my hand.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

1. Difference of creating a repo with existing files vs creating new files; 
2. It's usually best to push changes from a feature branch;  
3. Git workflow; 
4. When working in a team, it's always best to have someone else review the PR and merge; 
5. Committing a file requires 2 steps (add and commit) so that the developer can write one commit message for a group of changes that might be relevant;
6. Merge conflict basics.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

1. Is there a good way of remembering all the git commands? More practice!
2. Does pushing straight from a master branch not create a pull request on GitHub? No.
3. When resolving merge conflict, what does "<<<<<HEAD<<<<<<<" refer to? The start of the content 
4. Is there best practice when writing a commit message for resolving a merge conflict? No right answer. When working in a team, refer to team guidelines. There is also a default commit message by running "git commit".

* What still confuses you about Git?

Remembering all the different commands, and practicing good Git workflow.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

The GPS was great overall: Katy, our guide, gave clear explanations and pointed out important points. My pair, Alphonso, and I were on the same page throughout the session, and he was both a great driver and navigator. I might have asked a few too many questions that interrupted the session, but I will try to be more conscious about that.
